# DevOps-Course-Starter-Exercise-3

This is the third exercise of the course using Trello and the associated APIs; and sorting cards and being able to move them
across different lists. Simple tests have also been included, which will test the application is running and using Selenium to automatical create an item via the appropriate driver. 

TDD will take a non-programmer like me a little while to get used to, but the benefits are clearly there to see.
