# DevOps-Course-Starter-Exercise-2
Second Exercise with the whole lot refactored.

This is the second attempt of using Trello and the associated APIs to create a Flask application to simply allow the user to add and delete tasks. A simple class has been created, along with the functions and request calls to the appropriate end-points.

A slightly difference take on my first attempt, primarily as I've not used the original code or Poetry approach in anyway. It just stopped me from using my MAC and Windows machine at the same time, whislst flip-flopping between the two. Hence, I have stuck to the old fashioned way of doing things! Please don't tell me off :)
